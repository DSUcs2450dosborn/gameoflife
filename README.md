## Overview
This is an adaptation of the Conway Game of Life demonstration project available @

[https://makecode.microbit.org/examples/gameofLife/](https://makecode.microbit.org/examples/gameofLife)

#### GamePlay
Player uses button A to cycle the LED "universe" to the next "Conway stage". Each cycle increments player score.
Cycling to an empty universe or when the next cycle will duplicate the current costs 1 of the players 5 lives
Players can avoid the "death penalty" 3 times by using button B to trigger a universe reset.
Players start with 3 resets, but can earn extras if the current universe pattern matches the game logo
After all player deaths are exhausted, a new game can be started by shaking the unit after the logo is displayed
